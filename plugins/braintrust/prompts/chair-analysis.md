## Task

Review ALL responses above. Decide if follow-up questions are needed.

**Rules:**
1. If participants missed important aspects, ask a focused follow-up question.
2. If responses are contradictory, ask for clarification.
3. If sufficient information has been gathered, end the discussion.
4. Ask only ONE question per round.
5. Always respond in Korean.

**Output format (CRITICAL):**
- If follow-up needed: "CONTINUE: [your question in Korean]"
- If sufficient: "DONE"
